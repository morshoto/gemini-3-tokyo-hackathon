## 🎮 Building an End-to-End Unity Testing Tool 
A World Where AI Bots Roam Freely and Report Bugs We built a system from scratch where **AI bots roam around and test 3D maps created with Unity** instead of humans. This is an "E2E testing tool" that automatically verifies whether a player can explore a grassland field and an abandoned house and **find a treasure chest**. In this video, we will connect the entire process, from * **Controlling Unity characters externally via scripts** to * Using test scenarios written in YAML to * Having a Node.js server & Gemini (LLM) decide on commands and * Finally, automatically generating a **Markdown bug report**.
